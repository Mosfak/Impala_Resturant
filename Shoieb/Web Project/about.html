		Hadith are the transmitted narrations concerning the speech, actions, appearance, and approvals of the Messenger of Allah, the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). Hundreds of thousands of these narrations have been carefully preserved, studied, and passed down through the centuries, with many of them having undergone a strict procedure to verify an authentic chain of transmission up to the Prophet (pbuh). Hadith form the textual core of the Sunnah, an important source for the derivation of Islamic jurisprudence second only to the Qur'an. Hadith specialists have compiled hadith in various collections with differing criteria for inclusion, and not all hadith in all collections are necessarily authentic.
